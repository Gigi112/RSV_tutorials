# RSV tutorials
This Github repository contains tutorial materials for Pitzer-Weinberger's lab transitioning, mostly on work related to RSV.

We introduced several topics of interest. In each directory, you will find:

 1. an R project. I separated each topic as an independent R project.

 2. a PDF file, which has the same name as the directory. Read this file first to get an idea of the outline and prerequisite readings/materials of the topics. I deposited the prerequisite readings/materials either by links or PDFs in the same directory. Once you click the link in the tutorial PDF, you will be redirected to the prerequisite readings.

 3. a RMD file. This file is the source file for the PDF, you can read and run the codes for each chunk. **Note: you may need to combine several code chunks to have the correct version of code** because I separated them for the sake of creating a PDF. 

 4. Other codes and data files that are necessary to run the RMD file. 

 5. Dan and Ginny's lecture notes, which present the theoretical knowledge of the tutorial materials. 

The order of the tutorials was listed as follows:
