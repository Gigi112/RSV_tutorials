## Section 1: Background knowledge of estimating disease burden with statistical models.

There are 5 main statistical methods to estimate the hospitalization/mortality attributable to respiratory virus infection. In Dan's class, Public Health Surveillance, he teaches all four methods in details. Here, we will only give a brief introduction to each of the method and provide the link to the initial publications.

1. **Serfling regression**


2. **Periseason differences**


3. **Poisson regression with log link**

4. **Negative binomial regression with identity link**


5. **Box-Jenkins transfer function**
